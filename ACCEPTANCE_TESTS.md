# ACCEPTANCE TESTS - Route Migration Validation

**Purpose**: Gate checks to verify route integrity after each migration step.

**Requirements**: All tests must pass before proceeding to next step.

---

## Test 1: Development Server Boots

**Command**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Server starts on `http://localhost:5173`
- ✅ No fatal errors in terminal
- ✅ No console errors in browser on homepage

**Failure Conditions**:
- Server crashes or fails to start
- Import errors or missing dependencies
- Module resolution errors

---

## Test 2: Production Build Passes

**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ `dist/` directory is created
- ✅ No TypeScript/ESLint errors
- ✅ No SSG rendering errors
- ✅ All routes generate HTML files

**Failure Conditions**:
- Build fails with errors
- Missing route HTML files in `dist/`
- SSG pre-rendering failures

**Manual Verification**:
```bash
# Check that all expected HTML files exist
ls dist/index.html
ls dist/tools/index.html
ls dist/locations/index.html
ls dist/locations/omaha/index.html
ls dist/locations/omaha/dundee/index.html
ls dist/services/tree-removal/index.html
ls dist/services/tree-trimming/index.html
ls dist/services/tree-health-assessment/index.html
ls dist/services/winter-tree-prep/index.html
ls dist/emergency-tree-service-omaha/index.html
ls dist/tree-consultation-omaha/index.html
```

## Test 3: Sitemap Contains Only Canonical 200 URLs

**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
cat dist/sitemap.xml
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ `dist/sitemap.xml` exists
- ✅ Contains exactly these route patterns:
  - `/` (homepage)
  - `/tools`
  - `/locations`
  - `/locations/{city}` (8 cities)
  - `/locations/{city}/{neighborhood}` (29 neighborhoods)
  - `/services/{slug}` (4 services)
  - `/emergency-tree-service-omaha`
  - `/tree-consultation-omaha`
- ✅ NO `/404` in sitemap
- ✅ NO broken or malformed URLs
- ✅ All URLs are absolute (e.g., `https://omahatreecare.com/services/tree-removal`)

**Failure Conditions**:
- Missing routes in sitemap
- Malformed URLs (e.g., `/tree-removal` instead of `/services/tree-removal`)
- Duplicate URLs
- `/404` is present

**Manual Count Check**:
```bash
# Total expected routes in sitemap:
# 1 (homepage) + 1 (tools) + 1 (locations directory) + 8 (cities) + 29 (neighborhoods) + 4 (services) + 2 (special) = 46 URLs
grep -c "<url>" dist/sitemap.xml
# Expected output: 46
```

---

## Test 4: No Internal 404s (Local Crawl)

**Method**: Manual click-through or automated crawler

**Option A - Manual**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Open http://localhost:4173
# Click through navigation and footer links
# Verify no 404 pages
```

**Option B - Automated** (requires crawler tool):
```bash
# Example with wget spider (Windows: use WSL or skip)
wget --spider -r -nd -nv -l 3 -o crawl.log http://localhost:4173
grep "404" crawl.log
# Expected: No 404 entries
```

**Option C - Playwright Test** (future enhancement):
```javascript
// Example test (not implemented yet)
test('all internal links return 200', async ({ page }) => {
  const links = await page.$$eval('a[href^="/"]', els => els.map(e => e.href))
  for (const link of links) {
    const response = await page.goto(link)
    expect(response.status()).toBe(200)
  }
})
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All internal links return 200 status
- ✅ No navigation links point to 404
- ✅ Footer service links work
- ✅ Breadcrumb links work

**Failure Conditions**:
- Any internal link returns 404
- Missing route handlers
- Broken navigation

## Test 5: Every Indexed Page Has Non-Empty `<title>`

**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
# Check a sample of HTML files for title tags
```

**Manual Verification**:
```bash
# Homepage
grep -o "<title>[^<]*</title>" dist/index.html
# Expected: Non-empty title

# Service page
grep -o "<title>[^<]*</title>" dist/services/tree-removal/index.html
# Expected: Non-empty title

# Location page
grep -o "<title>[^<]*</title>" dist/locations/omaha/dundee/index.html
# Expected: Non-empty title

# Tools page
grep -o "<title>[^<]*</title>" dist/tools/index.html
# Expected: Non-empty title
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Every HTML file has `<title>` tag
- ✅ No empty titles (`<title></title>` or `<title> </title>`)
- ✅ Titles are descriptive and include brand name

**Failure Conditions**:
- Missing `<title>` tag
- Empty title content
- Generic titles like "Vite App"

**Automated Check** (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Get all HTML files and check for empty titles
Get-ChildItem -Path dist -Recurse -Filter *.html | ForEach-Object {
    $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    if ($content -match '<title>\s*</title>') {
        Write-Host "Empty title in: $($_.FullName)"
    }
}
```

---

## Test 6: Every Indexed Page Has Canonical Tag

**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
# Check HTML files for canonical links
```

**Manual Verification**:
```bash
# Homepage
grep -o '<link rel="canonical"[^>]*>' dist/index.html
# Expected: <link rel="canonical" href="https://omahatreecare.com/">

# Service page
grep -o '<link rel="canonical"[^>]*>' dist/services/tree-removal/index.html
# Expected: <link rel="canonical" href="https://omahatreecare.com/services/tree-removal">

# Location page
grep -o '<link rel="canonical"[^>]*>' dist/locations/omaha/dundee/index.html
# Expected: <link rel="canonical" href="https://omahatreecare.com/locations/omaha/dundee">
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Every HTML file has `<link rel="canonical">`
- ✅ Canonical URLs match the page's actual URL path
- ✅ All canonical URLs use `https://omahatreecare.com` domain
- ✅ No trailing slashes on canonical URLs (per vercel.json config)

**Failure Conditions**:
- Missing canonical tag
- Incorrect canonical URL (doesn't match page path)
- Relative URLs instead of absolute
- Wrong domain

**Automated Check** (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Get all HTML files and check for canonical tags
Get-ChildItem -Path dist -Recurse -Filter *.html | ForEach-Object {
    $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    if ($content -notmatch '<link rel="canonical"') {
        Write-Host "Missing canonical in: $($_.FullName)"
    }
}
```
