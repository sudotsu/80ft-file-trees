## EmailJS Setup (Required)

### Step 1: Get Your EmailJS Credentials

1. Go to https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up (or login if you have an account)
2. Create a new service:
   - Click "Add New Service"
   - Choose Gmail, Outlook, or your email provider
   - Connect your email account
   - Note your **Service ID** (looks like: `service_abc123`)

3. Create an email template:
   - Click "Email Templates" → "Create New Template"
   - Template Name: "Tree Care Contact Form"
   - Use this template structure:

```
Subject: New Tree Care Lead - {{urgency}} Priority

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Phone: {{phone}}
Address: {{address}}

Message:
{{message}}

Best Time to Call: {{best_time}}

---
Lead Details:
- Urgency: {{urgency}}
- Page Source: {{page_source}}
- Submitted: {{submission_date}} at {{submission_time}}
```

   - Note your **Template ID** (looks like: `template_xyz789`)

4. Get your Public Key:
   - Go to "Account" → "General"
   - Copy your **Public Key** (looks like: `w-AbCdEf123456`)

### Step 2: Update the Code

Open `src/components/ContactForm.jsx` and replace these lines (around line 32):

```javascript
// TODO: Replace these with your actual EmailJS credentials
const SERVICE_ID = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID'      // Replace with service_abc123
const TEMPLATE_ID = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'    // Replace with template_xyz789
const PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'      // Replace with w-AbCdEf123456
```

**With your actual credentials:**

```javascript
const SERVICE_ID = 'service_abc123'       // Your actual service ID
const TEMPLATE_ID = 'template_xyz789'     // Your actual template ID
const PUBLIC_KEY = 'w-AbCdEf123456'       // Your actual public key
```

### Step 3: Test the Forms

1. Build and run locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

2. Navigate to `/tools`
3. Complete the hazard assessment with different risk scores
4. Test each path:
   - HIGH risk → Emergency page → Fill out form
   - MEDIUM risk → Consultation page → Fill out form
   - LOW risk → Email modal → Enter email

5. Check your email for form submissions!
